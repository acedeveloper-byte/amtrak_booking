                                    that may apply

                                <p>
                                    Airline tickets purchased via the Website are subject to the written conditions of carriage and regulations
                                    of the relevant airline and its offering, including but not limited to cancellation policy and other terms of
                                    use. When given, the contract of carriage in use by the applicable airline is between the applicable airline
                                    and the customer. Airlines reserve the right to amend flight times and schedules at any time; schedule
                                    adjustments can result in an itinerary that violates the Company's contractual agreements. Airlines can
                                    also adjust or cancel flights or itineraries at their discretion.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Company makes every effort to publish and preserve correct pricing and statistics for its airline
                                    services, and the airlines supply the Company with price and other information about these services. If
                                    the Company lists or provides a service at an incorrect price or with erroneous details due to a
                                    typographical mistake or any error in pricing or service information obtained from an airline, the Company
                                    and/or the airline reserve the right to reject or postpone all orders made for that service prior to charging
                                    the mode of payment.</p>

                                <h4> Tax and Fee Charges on Published Price Airline Tickets </h4>
                                <p>Government taxes and fees, as well as airline fees, are either included in your fare or individually itemized
                                    on your checkout page to include a travel bill. The tax rates in place at the time you buy your ticket are
                                    added to the cost of your ticket. The traveler may be liable for retroactive tax rate changes. Exit and
                                    entrance fees that are not included in your travel expense or that are itemized individually on your
                                    checkout page may be paid for international flights. On published-price airline itineraries that comprise
                                    more than one carrier, a non-refundable charge can be charged per ticket.</p>


                                <h4> Changes to the Itinerary </h4>
                                <p> If itinerary changes are allowed by airline fare law, the relevant airline can charge a change fee. These
                                    change fees are paid per ticket and vary by industry, carrier, and basic fare law, but are usually between
                                    $75.00 and $300.00. (USD). Itinerary modifications can cost more than these numbers, and certain
                                    changes may be unavailable. These adjustment payments are in addition to the applicable variation in
                                    ticket rates. Furthermore, any modifications to your itinerary made by the Company may result in
                                    additional processing fees. </p>


                                <h4> Cancellation and Refund </h4>
                                <p> Within 24 hours, the number of tickets purchased and the service fees paid for booking are nonrefundable. </p>
                                <p> Any cancellation made after 24 hours is subject to the airline's policies. However, there will be a
                                    cancellation charge. </p>
                                <p> Tickets may be canceled for a fee within 24 hours by contacting our 24/7 service. </p>
                                <p> In the event of a no-show, the ticket is non-refundable, and the airline forfeits the entire fee. Please
                                    contact us at least 4 hours before the flight departure to prevent a no-show. </p>
                                <p> Changes in the passenger name(s) are not permitted until a ticket has been booked, according to airline
                                    policy. Any modifications to the itinerary are limited and subject to the regulations of the relevant airline. </p>
                                <p> Both low-cost airline tickets booked within 7 days (168 hours) of the departure date are non-refundable
                                    once bought. </p>
                                <p> The fee charged for hotel and rental car reservations is non-refundable in all circumstances. However,
                                    subscription fees for making hotel reservations and rental car reservations can be refundable. </p>
                                <p> Cancellations for plane tickets, hotel reservations, and rental car reservations must be made over the
                                    phone only. We would only consider refund requests if the following conditions are met: </p>
                                <p> If you have sent a cancellation and refund order to us, provided that the fare laws provide for cancellation
                                    and refunds. </p>
                                <p> Whether you aren't a "no-show." The term "no show" applies to a case in which a passenger is not
                                    present at the airport at the time of boarding the flight and gives no detail to the airline. In most cases, a
                                    “no show” booking is unavailable for any retailer waiver on refund collection. </p>
                                <p> We may obtain exemptions from vendors when handling the requested cancellation and refund. However,
                                    it is likely that we will not all be able to do so. </p>


                                <p> We are unable to include a clear time period for the time it will take to process the requested refund. Both
                                    refund claims are processed in a strict sequential order. </p>
                                <p> If you have sent a cancellation order to our customer support representative, you will get an e-mail from
                                    us confirming that the request has been made. Receiving a notification, though, does not guarantee that
                                    you will get a refund. The e-mail update simply acknowledges receipt of your request and provides you
                                    with a tracking number. When we get your cancellation and compensation order, we will contact the
                                    providers, such as airlines, hotels, and car rental agencies, to generate a waiver, but only if it is available
                                    for a refund. The supplier's decision will be binding, and we will remind you of it. Our operation costs for
                                    the initial reservation or booking are non-refundable. Please be advised that when it comes to collecting
                                    the desired refunds, we are totally reliant on the judgment of the vendors. </p>
                                <p> Please keep in mind that refunds are only available if the airline/supplier rules allow for them. It may take
                                    60-90 days from submitting your request to receiving credit on your statement until the requested refund
                                    has been accepted by the supplier. Aside from the redemption rates charged by airlines and other
                                    providers, Amtrakticket.com will charge a post-ticketing operation fee as and where necessary. Both
                                    redemption costs are paid on a per-passenger, per-ticket basis. The reimbursement payments are only
                                    valid if the seller has approved a refund or a waiver has been issued. Although the desired
                                    reimbursement is not processed by the retailer, we will reimburse you for the post-ticketing service costs. </p>
